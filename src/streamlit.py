    This model was trained on a mixture of:
    - **Wikipedia articles** (across multiple topics like history, earth science, and computer science)
    - **Parallel TED Talk translations**
    
    It classifies input into one of 5 Romance languages: Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, or Romanian with English, and with a 7th fallback category of **Unknown**.

    **Note:** This is a basic n-gram based model and not a full transformer or deep language model. It's fast and lightweight, but **may not be accurate on short, slangy, or ambiguous sentences**.
